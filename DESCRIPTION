Description: 'Apache Drill' is a low-latency distributed query engine designed to enable 
    data exploration and 'analytics' on both relational and non-relational 'datastores', 
    scaling to petabytes of data. Methods are provided that enable working with 'Apache' 
    'Drill' instances via the 'JDBC' 'DBI' and 'dplyr'/'dbplyr' idioms.
